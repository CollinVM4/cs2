How java handles data structures 

Extension of the iterable interface

Key Interfaces: List, Set, Map, Queue


ArrayList : resizable array, grows as u add, shrinks as u delete
            can hold various datatypes at once
declare like... ArrayList<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();

myList.add("Apple"); // can also do like myList.add(2, "apple") // adds as second element


LinkedList : slow for random access, however good for frequent deletions and inserts

HashMap : keys stored in a hash table. It is possible that different key might have 
           the same has value.
