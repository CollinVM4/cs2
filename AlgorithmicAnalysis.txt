Math Review
summations- for loops...
** polynomials in this class will always be expanded
** tests will be open note, open 6pm thur - friday 11:59pm
** MUST TYPE it up, submit as pdf...
** labs begin next week, 5/28/25
** there will be 3 TESTS
** diagrams.net for grahics for tests, homework.

Logarithms are sort of inverse functions of Exponents
b^y = x, logb(x)= y
Rules to logarithms, product, quotient, power, base change, base switch 
Rules to Exponents, product, quotient, power


Time Analysis 
T(n) to denote the running time of an algorithm, 
aka the amt of computer operations (comparisons, data moves)
* What s each statement in the algorithm?
* How many operations does each statement take?
* How comparable are the operations.
we are really doing an "asymptotic order analysis"... 
How does this program act as data GROWS?


Asymptotic Upper Bound, F(n) <= K * G(n) (actions will always be lesser or equal to G(n)) BIG O
Asymptotic Lower Bound, AKA BEST CASE. BIG OMEGA
Big THETA, the intersection of the two Omega, Theta
